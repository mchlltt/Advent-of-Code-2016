# Advent of Code 2016
A repo to hold my answers for [Advent of Code 2016](http://adventofcode.com/)! Most of my experience in Python to-date has been modifying and building on others' work, so I'm planning to use Python for the entire month to build up my fundamentals as well as my ability to code solutions from scratch.
